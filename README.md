## Running

```bash

cd exercises

# install our exercises' libraries
npm install

# run the test suite one time
npm test
# or to run the test continuously watching for changes
npm run test:continuous

# fix the code and then run the test(s) again and again till they all pass
npm run test

# If you just want to run one test suite and not all of them to keep the screen noise low
